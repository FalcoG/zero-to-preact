# Zero to Preact Router

This is a basic set-up you'll want in order to get up and running with Preact, Preact Router and Webpack 2.

Note that for most projects, you'll want to use [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli) to bootstrap your preact projects.

This repository is based on [zero-to-preact](https://github.com/developit/zero-to-preact).
