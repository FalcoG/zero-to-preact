[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/developit/zero-to-preact.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is the bare minimum you'll want in order to get up and running with Preact and Webpack 2.

You don't need to clone this repository as a boilerplate - the [commit history](https://github.com/developit/zero-to-preact/commits/master) is actually a _step-by-step guide_! It will walk you through setting things up yourself.  Give it a try, you might be surprised how easy it is ðŸ™‚
